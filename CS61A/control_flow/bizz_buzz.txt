Write a procedure, bizz_buzz, that takes a number, n as an argument. It will
then print something for each number between 1 and n, following these rules:

- If the number is divisible by 2 print “bizz”.
- If the number is divisible by 3, print “buzz”.
- If the number is divisible by both 2 and 3, print “bizzbuzz”.
- Otherwise, simply print the number.

Here is an example:
>>> bizz_buzz(8)
1
bizz
buzz
bizz
5
bizzbuzz
7
bizz
