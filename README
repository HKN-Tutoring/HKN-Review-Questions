# How to use this repo:

## For the review session, you created:

### 1) A Google Docs Presentation. Then you should put the following in the relevant directory:

*   A PDF version of the slides
*   A file called original.txt, that contains the url of a version of the presentation that can be edited/copied by anyone with an @hkn.eecs account (Correct sharing permissions are important! This repo is public.)

### 2) A worksheet/presentation using Latex/Powerpoint/Other.  Then you should put the following in the relevant directory:

*   A PDF version of the worksheet/slides
*   The original tex or ppt (basically the source file that can be modified to produce a new version)
*   Any other files (figures, other included pdfs) necessary to produce a usable output from the source (tex/ppt/other)
