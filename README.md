# How to use this repo:

## For the review session, you created:

### 1) A Google Docs Presentation. Then you should put the following in the relevant directory:

*   A PDF version of the slides
*   A file called original.txt, that contains the url of the presentation in google docs. You should set the permissions to view-only. Anyone who wishes to use the slides in the future can then go to the url and click File -> Make a Copy to get an editable copy. Permissions are important! This repo is public.

### 2) A worksheet/presentation using Latex/Powerpoint/Other.  Then you should put the following in the relevant directory:

*   A PDF version of the worksheet/slides
*   The original tex or ppt (basically the source file that can be modified to produce a new version)
*   Any other files (figures, other included pdfs) necessary to produce a usable output from the source (tex/ppt/other)
